ColorMixCalculator
==================

First Android app with published source code

There is nothing really fancy about this app.  The only purpose of this app is for me to play around
with Android development.

Also, this app has been developed on an Android device using [AIDE](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.aide.ui, "AIDE on Google Play").
